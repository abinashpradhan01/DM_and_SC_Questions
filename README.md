Neural Networks learn from data using **Supervised** and **Unsupervised** learning methods.  

âœ… **Supervised Learning:**  
- **Definition:** The model is trained with labeled data.  
- **Example:**  
  - Input: (Image of cat â†’ Label: "Cat")  
  - Output: Model predicts if itâ€™s a cat or not.  
- **Uses:** Image classification, Speech recognition.  

âœ… **Unsupervised Learning:**  
- **Definition:** The model finds patterns in **unlabeled data**.  
- **Example:**  
  - Input: Customer data.  
  - Output: The model groups similar customers (clustering).  
- **Uses:** Market segmentation, Anomaly detection.
